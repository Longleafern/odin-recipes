<p>I sat on the couch searching my soul for the reasons my entire family left me. The list of foibles was long but I couldn't 
    pin down any exact reason as to what would make them leave. It was from that moment on that I had to decide what kind of 
    man I wanted to be. Did I want to be the kind of man that would let his family fall by the wayside and start a life of
    debauchary and slefishness. Or did I want to step up and be the man that my family always wanted me to be. That Sunday was 
    cold and I was hungry. That's what led me to discovering this delicious lasagna recipe. That and the pool of my families
    blood made me hungry for pasta sauce. 
</p>
<p>For this recipe you'll need appromiately 2 hours. You can make the noodles fresh and you can make the riccotta fresh but fuck that
    noise. When your families bodies lay on the floor you want your lasagna and then you want to get out of there before the police arrive. 
    Anyway.

    <h3><em>Instructions</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4><p>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 2</h4><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 3</h4><p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).        </p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 4</h4><p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p></li>
        <li><h4>step 5</h4><p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.        </p></li>
    </ul>
