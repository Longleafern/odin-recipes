<p>Jac' Pepin once said that carrots are good. I believe him because
    he is french. That's pretty much all it takes to convince me that 
    some kind of food is good. French Bread, French people, French cigaretes?
    It's all great. Eat them smoke them do them and be marry." 
    Anyway here is a recipe for hot carrots.
